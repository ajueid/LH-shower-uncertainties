\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:psunc:intro}

Here is what we did two years ago \cite{AlcarazMaestre:2012vp}. Which is 
nothing wrt. to parton shower uncertainties.

parton shower work horses for collider physics prediction since gazillion years

used both as dat astand-in and in theory predictions

its exclusive and fully-differential resummation 
indespensible for particle level predictions

however, until now no systematic uncertainty treatment on resummation 
properties generally available

keep it short
