\section{Conclusions}
\label{sec:psunc:conclusions}
Clearly there is a need to find a robust prescription to produce variations
that we can definitively call `shower-uncertainties'. Such a prescription
should not only be theoretically grounded, but also practical in its use. This
will require further studies with more detailed appraisals of the different
shower components and their interplay with rest of the event generation
machinery. All of the multi-purpose event generators are able to assign
uncertainties to their prescription and so will enable more detailed studies
in the future.
